Nitro FPGA ISO7816 UART core
============================

ISO7816 interface core

There isn't much in terms of documentation beyond the register map
in doc/registers.md and the comments in the rtl sources.

However, during the time of initial development of this softcore, there
was a video presentation [Open Hardware ISO7816 FPGA
core](https://media.ccc.de/v/osmodevcall-20210924-tnt-iso7816) as part
of the
[OsmoDevCall](https://osmocom.org/projects/osmo-dev-con/wiki/OsmoDevCall)
series of talks.
